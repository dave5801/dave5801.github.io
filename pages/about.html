  <p class="about-section-header">A passion for science</p>
  <p class="about-section-text">This is an ongoing project for CodeFellows in Seattle. I have a genuine love of 
    the sciences. I am interested in a variety of fields but decided to use this as an opportunity
    to familiarize myself with the basics of one field I'm weak at: chemistry. Studying th Periodic Table
    is a great way to gain a general understanding of the elements and the people who discovered them.</p>
  <p class="about-section-header">My Goals</p>
  <p class="about-section-text">It is important to test ones limits and stay ahead of emerging trends in innovation.
  I strive for excellence in both science and engineering. I am building a personal portfolio which combines practical 
software development experience and advanced scientific knowledge.</p>
  <p class="about-section-header">What I've Learned</p>
  <p class="about-section-text">I have certainly gained a basic understanding of the Periodic Table of Elements. However, what is most fascinating is the personal stories of the researchers who made contributions to the fields of physics and chemistry.</p>
